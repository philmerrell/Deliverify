## Deliverify Admin
"Deliverify" was developed for the Udacity Tech Entrepreneur Nanodegree program. The objective for this project was to create low-fidelity mock ups, gather user feedback, and then develop a high fidelity mock up.  This repo represents the high fidelity mock up of my product idea. Its purpose is to help restaraunts create a menu app for their customers in addition to managing orders and deliveries. By taking advantage of modern browser features such as geolocation and real-time client updates, this product aims to offer a superior order and delivery experience for both customers and business owners.
